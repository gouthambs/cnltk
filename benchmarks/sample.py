Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national
economic activity continued to expand during the reporting period of
mid-November through late December, with most Districts reporting a "modest"
or "moderate" pace of growth. In contrast, the Kansas City District reported
only slight growth in December. However, most of their contacts, along with
those of several other Districts, expect somewhat faster growth over the
coming months. The Dallas District indicated that growth slowed slightly
during the reporting period and that several contacts expressed concern about
the effect of lower oil prices on the District economy. Consumer spending
increased in most Districts, with generally modest year-over-year gains in
retail sales. Auto sales showed moderate to strong growth. Travel and
tourism picked up during the reporting period. The pace of growth of demand
for nonfinancial services varied widely across Districts and across sectors,
but appeared to be moderate on balance. Manufacturing activity expanded in
most Districts. Single-family residential real estate sales and construction
were largely flat on balance across the Districts, while commercial real estate
activity expanded. Demand for business and consumer credit grew. Credit quality
improved a bit further overall. Agricultural conditions were mixed. Overall
demand for energy-related products and services weakened somewhat, while the
output of energy-related products increased.

Payrolls in a variety of sectors expanded moderately during the reporting
period. Significant wage pressures were largely limited to workers with
specialized technical skills. Prices increased slightly, on balance, in most
Districts.

Consumer spending increased in most Districts, with generally modest
year-over-year gains in retail sales. Contacts reported slight to modest gains
in the Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts. Sales were solid
in Atlanta. Moderate holiday sales growth exceeded expectations in Chicago and
met expectations in San Francisco. General merchandise retailers in the New
York District indicated that sales were largely sluggish and below plan for the
holiday season. The Kansas City District reported that retail sales were lower
than a year earlier, with a few retailer contacts noting a drop in sales of
high-end products. In contrast, Philadelphia and San Francisco reported that
high-end merchandise continued to sell well.
